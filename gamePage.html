    <h3 class = "boxes"> Game Purpose: This game is meant to be an interactive platform where users can learn about how climate change impacts polar bears in a simple and accessible
    way. Over the course of the game, the icebergs get smaller and eventually disappear. This is meant to symbolize how global warming has resulted in a loss
    of sea ice in the Arctic. Polar bears depend on sea ice to survive; sea ice serves as their hunting ground. With the sea ice melting, polar
    bears are struggling to survive and are on the path to extinction. By creating this game, we hope to make it easier for people to learn about how global
    warming is changing the Arctic and threatening the survival of polar bears. </h3>
