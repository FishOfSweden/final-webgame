      <h1> The Facts: </h1>
      <h3>
        <p>
        ~ The polar bear is an endangered species.
        </p>
<p>
~ Polar bears need to eat around 12,325 calories per day according to a recent study, 60% more than what scientists had previously thought.
</p>
<p>
~ Sea ice is shrinking 14% per decade due to climate change, causing major changes in the Arctic and affects the eating patterns of polar bears.
</p>
<p>
~ There has been a decrease of 770,000 square miles since the median measurement in data from 1981-2010.
</p>
<p>
~ It is predicted that by 2050, the population of bears will be reduced to 10,000, two-thirds less than now.
</p>

<p>
~ There has been a 40% decrease in population in the last 10 years in the Beaufort Sea region.

<p><h3>
~ The population in the Beaufort Sea deminished from 1,500 to 900 bears. "This is a clear warning sign of the impact a warming Arctic has on ice-dependent species like the polar bear," stated Dr. Pete Ewins, WWF Senior Species Officer in Canada.
