      <h1> The Facts </h1>
      <h3>
        <div>~ The polar bear is an endangered species.</div>
				<div>~ Polar bears need to eat around 12,325 calories per day according to a recent study, 60% more than what scientists had previously thought.</div>
				<div>~ Sea ice is shrinking 14% per decade due to climate change, causing major changes in the Arctic and affects the eating patterns of polar bears.</div>
				<div>~ There has been a decrease of 770,000 square miles of sea ice since the median measurement in data from 1981-2010.</div>
				<div>~ It is predicted that by 2050, the population of bears will be reduced to 10,000, two-thirds less than now. At the current rate, they are expected to go extinct in approximately 2100. </div>
				<div>~ There has been a 40% decrease in polar bear population in the last 10 years in the Beaufort Sea region.</div>
				<div>~ The population in the Beaufort Sea region deminished from 1,500 to 900 bears. "This is a clear warning sign of the impact a warming Arctic has on ice-dependent species like the polar bear," stated Dr. Pete Ewins, WWF Senior Species Officer in Canada.</h3></div>
