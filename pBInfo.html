      <h1> The Facts </h1>
      <h3>
        <p>~ The polar bear is an endangered species.</p>
				<p>~ Polar bears need to eat around 12,325 calories per day according to a recent study, 60% more than what scientists had previously thought.</p>
				<p>~ Sea ice is shrinking 14% per decade due to climate change, causing major changes in the Arctic and affects the eating patterns of polar bears.</p>
				<p>~ There has been a decrease of 770,000 square miles since the median measurement in data from 1981-2010.</p>
				<p>~ It is predicted that by 2050, the population of bears will be reduced to 10,000, two-thirds less than now.</p>
				<p>~ There has been a 40% decrease in population in the last 10 years in the Beaufort Sea region.</p>

				<p><h3>~ The population in the Beaufort Sea deminished from 1,500 to 900 bears. "This is a clear warning sign of the impact a warming Arctic has on ice-dependent species like the polar bear," stated Dr. Pete Ewins, WWF Senior Species Officer in Canada.</h3></p>
